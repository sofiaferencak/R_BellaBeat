They develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.  \n\nBellabeat’s products:  \n\n- Bellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n- Leaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n- Time: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n- Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n- Bellabeat membership: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.  \n\n## Business Task\nIn this analysis of smart device usage data the business task is to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices in order to make recommendations for how these trends can be used by the Bellabeat marketing team.  \n\nI focused on the Bellabeat membership to find areas that could be improved allowing it to grow the features it offers their users, and also attract more users to it.  \n\n## Database \nFor this analysis I used the “FitBit Fitness Tracker Data” data set, that is publicly available in Kaggle. It contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. It consists of 2 folders with 29 csv files, which some are duplicates, with data organized by minute, hour and day on different files. This data has limitations mainly because of the year it was collected and the sample data size. \nThis dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.\nCitation: Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894\n\n## **Process** \nDuring this process I used Google Sheets to check, clean and format the data. Then I used R for the analysis and visualizations. I decided to use R because it gives me the option to easily replicate the analysis, which we’d be useful if the data set is updated for example. It also allows me to keep a detailed summary of the steps I took using an R Markdown file.  \n\nFirst I downloaded the files from Kaggle, unzipped them and uploaded them to Google Sheets to process it and get it ready for analysis. Of the data set files I used:\ndailyActivity_merged.csv  \ndailyCalories_merged.csv  \ndailyIntensities_merged.csv  \ndailySteps_merged.csv  \nsleepDay_merged.csv  \nweightLogInfo_m  \nhourlyCalories_merged.csv  \nhourlyIntensities_merged.csv  \nhourlySteps_merged.csv  \n\nIn Google Sheets I divided the Date-Time column in date and time separately and formatted them accordingly. For the hourly files the time column I formatted it as integers to make the visualizations more clear using a format of 1-24 hours. Then I looked for duplicated data and data that might have been entered incorrectly so I could correct it to the right format. After checking all the data was good for analysis I downloaded the files as csv format.  \n\nNow I was ready to use R for the analysis of the data. I logged into R Studio, an online tool I used for this assignment, and started with an R file and a R Markdown file to keep track of the steps I took.  \n\n## **Analysis**\n\n## Set up the enviroment\nIn order to do the analysis first I needed to install and load packages into the environment.

Those time frames will be better to push recipes and tips for healthy eating to users.  \n\n## Conclusions\nI’ll focus on the Bellabeat Membership. After what the analysis showed I can make the following recommendations to the bellabeat team:  \n- They should focus their marketing to people that are interested in improving their health, maybe for a better life quality. \n- They should add a feature that allows users to keep track of their caloric intake. It would be useful for example for people that use the app to try to lose weight or are in a regimen for mass and muscle building.\n- They should market the sleep and healthy weight log features because those are the ones people use less but they could benefit from them, so it might mean that the users are not aware or don’t know how to use them. \n- They could suggest recipes for healthy meals or snacks around the periods of times when people are more active which will make them hungry and they will most likely be looking for something to cook.\n- They could use a reward system or suggestions for people about their daily steps based on the suggested amount by medical professionals. \n- They could suggest to them they can be more active if they want to help improve their sleep patterns and they can track it using a sleep log feature in the app. \n- All of these suggestions will be better offered around the times from 12:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 and 19:00, because that’s where people are more active and take the most steps.\n","metadata":{}}]}
